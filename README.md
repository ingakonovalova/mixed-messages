# Mixed-messages
# General info
This project was created in the scope of Full-Stack Engineer Career Path in Codecademy. 

The program returns random weather forecasts for randomly taken Estonia cities every time it is run. The cities and weather adjectives are read from .csv files, then parsed and saved into arrays. Degrees are generated randomly and there is also an array storing values if the temperature is "below" or "above" zero. 

At first the program reads in the data and later prints to the console a string with randomly chosen values from arrays and the randomly generated temperature.
